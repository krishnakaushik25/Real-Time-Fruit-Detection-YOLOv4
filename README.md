## Business Objective

This particular project is about building a robust model for fruit detections. There can be many advanced use cases for this. Some of them are:
1. You are working in a warehouse where lakhs of fruits come in daily, and if you try
to separate and package each of the fruit boxes manually, it will require a lot of
workforce. So, you can build an automated system that can detect fruits and
separate them for packaging.

2. You are the owner of a vast orchid. If you want to harvest fruits from it manually, it
will require a lot of workforces too. You can build a robot or a self-driving truck
that can detect fruits on specific trees and harvest them for you.

## Goal
To build a robust fruit detection system using YOLOv4
